The entire point of this program was to avoid
using that drop-down menu on miami course list

could've just been, like, a text box
but noooooo
just had to be a weird search check box thing

i just wanna type the course thingybobber

i do not know whether or not it was worth it


make

./a.out CSE 174

result is in out.csv (and out.html)
some info is printed to stdout
hopefully
